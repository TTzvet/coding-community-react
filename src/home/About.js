                        <h3>Our purpose...</h3>
                        <p>There are currently various networking events for women in technology, but not so many places where women have the opportunity to connect and communicate with other women in technology outside of these events.</p>
                        <p>The Women&apos;s Coding Community is addressing this gap by providing a platform for women in coding, a place where they can <em>meet, communicate and collaborate</em> with each other. WCC is for females at the beginning of their journey in coding as well as for those who are professionals. The purpose of the community is to <em>bring women in coding together</em>, in a place where they can share their experiences, concerns, ask for support and advice. WCC aims to help women to aspire in coding by building a strong, supportive environment where they can discuss anything, from professional topics such as interview tips, to personal concerns like how to deal with impostor syndrome at work.</p>

                        <h3>Our community...</h3>
                        <p>The community&apos;s discussion forum is a place where members can post or answer questions on any relevant topic. Furthermore, women who want to introduce themselves and their story can do so in our blog area. We encourage everyone who joins the community to post something about themselves and their journey &ndash; <em>to help others to get to know you better or to inspire them</em>!</p>
                        <p>The members of the community will also be able to post information about themselves in their accounts which are visible to other members. There is a field in which you can add information about your contribution to the community, this is the place to tell everyone how you would like to take part in the community &ndash; whether you are able to help with code review, mock interviews, you are looking for a coding buddy to do pair programming or someone to contribute to your project. This is the place to tell everyone if you are open for contribution and what type of of contribution you are interested in.</p>
                        <p>Thank you for being here, we really hope that you can join us as a member and help us grow our community!</p>
